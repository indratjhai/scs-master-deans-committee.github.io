          <div class="note-type">Opportunities</div>
          <ul class="plus">
            <li>LTI (Alexandra Balobeshinka helming) has created a spreadsheet for internship opportunities in light of the
              Covid-19 situation. We think that this would be a fantastic resource for students (especially master's) even
              in normal times for both internships and full time. We think that there may be value in having this as a SCS
              wide initiative since there are many cross-disciplinary opportunities. Additionally, having the SCS resume
              book during normal times would be quite helpful in our opinion.</li>
            <ul class="plus">
              <li>They'll look into this further, generally from Alumni</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <div class="note-type">Registration</div>
          <ul class="plus">
            <li>Registration is a crucial process for every student, but especially so for master's students who have a
              compressed time at CMU. Master's students are also in the unique position of taking classes that often have
              either advanced seniors or PhDs in them. Since the registration day for master's students is one day later
              than for senior undergraduates and PhDs, for many classes, they get cut out. We believe that this is unfair
              and that all students who are in their last semester (or year) should register at the same time. I believe
              this issue has plagued nearly every master's student who has attended CMU and likely is one of the single
              biggest changes CMU can make to improve the educational experience of master's students.</li>
            <ul class="plus">
              <li>They'll look into this both via new sections and by prioritizing via time to graduation</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <div class="note-type">Space</div>
          <ul class="plus">
            <li>Space affects everyone in SCS. Today, RI students received an email indicating that a highly utilized lounge
              on the 4th floor of NSH is being converted into lab space for incoming faculty. No one has any problems with
              making space for new faculty, but there is no concrete guarantee or plan to get that space back. In
              particular this negatively impacts coursework masters students (MRSD, MSCV) who do not have the luxury of
              having a desk at the lab. What plans does SCS have to get departments more space? (We have heard rumors of a
              new building for RI - what stops the execution of obtaining a new building?)</li>
            <ul class="plus">
              <li>New building doesn't seem to be anytime soon. Will try to consolidate space and acquire new space near
                campus</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <div class="note-type">Resources</div>
          <ul class="plus">
            <li>We think that SCS master's students would greatly appreciate access to computing resources (such as AWS
              credits). Much of the work that students need to do requires computational resources far beyond what most
              have access to normally. Additionally, a budget like this would allow students to work on personal projects
              which only enhance student capability and lead to new innovations, thereby increasing the already impressive
              clout of CMU CS. These resources would be even more helpful given the reduced capacity of CMU's on-campus
              resources at the moment.</li>
            <ul class="plus">
              <li>They will Look into aws credits for student projects as an educational experience</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <div class="note-type">Housing</div>
          <ul class="plus">
            <li>Many students are facing uncertainty when it comes to housing for the Fall semester as they are unable to
              see housing before signing leases for the fall. If there are any resources or help you could provide to
              these students, it would be greatly appreciated. </li>
            <ul class="plus">
              <li>Inventory resources currently available</li>
              <li>They will look into negotiations with certain players</li>
