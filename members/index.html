                Hi! I’m Kiran Prasad and I was born in Buffalo, NY. I’m currently studying AI in the MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program in LT (class of 2021)I. I have particular interest in adversarial robustness, representations, and applications of AI to business problems. I did my undergrad at the University of Michigan where I studied Chemical Engineering and Computer Science (go blue!). If you’re interested in my professional profile please check out: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kpprasa" target="_blank">www.linkedin.com/in/kpprasa</a><br><br>I thoroughly enjoy learning about different fields having interest in physics, math, entrepreneurship, and philosophy (I’m way too into philosophy xD). To balance out all of that intellectual stuff, I really enjoy doing things outdoors (camping, biking, backpacking, swimming) and traveling (24 countries), yoga and meditation, and exploring (restaurants, bars, parks, cities, etc). Look forward to hearing from you!

                Greetings! I’m Lijun Yu, an international student from China. I’m a second-year Master in Language Technologies (MLT) and an incoming PhD student at LTI. I have broad research interest in computer vision, video analytics, and multimodal action detection. I graduated summa cum laude from Peking University, China, with double bachelor’s degrees in computer science and economics. You can learn more about me at <a href="https://me.lj-y.com" target="_blank">https://me.lj-y.com</a>.<br><br>I love building things, especially electronic ones, from a smart home system, a personal computer, to a large cluster. I would hope that I could rebuild the empire of computer science even if the world were nuked. I used to travel much even in semesters, and I hope to resume as soon as the pandemic is over.

                Hi! I am Romel Baral. I am a masters student in MSCB (Master of Science in Computational Biology) program; I expect to graduate in May, 2021. I was born in Kolkata, India. After finishing my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computing, I worked for Goldman Sachs for four years in algorithmic trading before joining CMU. My academic interests lie in application of Machine Learning in biological and financial data. Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romelbaral/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/romelbaral/</a><br><br>I love to cook, travel and banter about politics, mythology, religion etc. I cook almost every day, mainly traditional dishes found in Indian subcontinent. I have special interest in peasant food across the world and I try to replicate them as closely as I am able to. I love to hike and love going on day trips. When I have time, I usually pick a hiking trail and walk for hours. I used to travel a lot while working, hopefully I regain that enthusiasm after my CMU years. I also love watching anime and tv shows (especially USA and british ones). Being a homosexual person, I felt the need of LGBTQ wellfare in India. I used to be quite involved in LGBTQ activism, and even took part in the Supreme Court case that amended colonial section 377 in favor of LGBTQ people. Looking forward to hearing from you!

I was previously an undergrad here at CMU, majoring in Information Systems + Statistics and Machine Learning. Throughout my time here at CMU I’ve done a few fun things, including TAed classes for the IS and ML departments, held multiple executive positions in Student Government, sat on too many university committees, served on the board of the CMU Business Technology Group, changed major plans twice, judged a chili cook-off, and threw the first pitch at a Pittsburgh Pirates game.<br><br>In my ample spare time I play the drums, jam out unironically to mid-2000s pop music, stare at my computer screen wondering why my code doesn’t work, rock climb, reminisce about when I used to actually remember my black belt-level kung fu, overanalyze the latest Christopher Nolan film, and annoy my friends with spontaneous pop culture references.
